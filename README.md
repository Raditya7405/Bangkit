## Bike Sharing Usage Data Analysis
This project explores bike-sharing data, focusing on the influence of working days, holidays, seasons, and weather conditions on bike usage. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help optimize bike-sharing operations.

## Project Overview
The dataset includes records of bike rentals and factors that potentially affect usage, such as:

Working Days vs. Holidays: Analyzing the difference in bike demand.
Weather Conditions: Evaluating the effect of temperature, humidity, and weather types on usage.
Seasonal Trends: Understanding how different seasons impact bike rentals.
The project aims to deliver a comprehensive view of how external conditions influence bike usage, enabling better planning and operational strategies.

## How to Run the Dashboard
To explore the insights interactively, you can run the dashboard locally:
### 1. Clone this Repository
'''bash
  git clone https://dashboardpy-h6camnnxkef9tkgzykk43r.streamlit.app/
  cd submission
  '''

### 2. Install Dependencies
  The next step is to install all requiered dependencies
  '''bash
  pip install -r requirement.txt
  '''
### 3. Run Dashboard with Streamlit
  Use the following command
  '''bash
  streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py
  '''

## Analysis Details
The analysis process covers the following:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handling missing values and transforming data for better analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating the dataset to find patterns and trends in bike usage.
3. Key Insights: Summarizing the findings:
    - Higher usage on working days compared to holidays.
    - Summer and spring seasons show peak usage, while winter sees a significant drop.
    - Adverse weather conditions (rain, snow) lead to lower usage.

## Required Libraries
The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy: For efficient numerical calculations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations and plots.
- Streamlit: To create and deploy the dashboard.

## Insights and Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, here are some actionable recommendations:
- Operational Adjustments: Consider increasing bike availability during working days and summer seasons.
- Weather-Dependent Planning: Introduce adaptive pricing or targeted promotions during poor weather conditions.
- Holiday-Specific Strategies: Develop marketing strategies to boost holiday usage, which tends to be lower than on regular working days.

## Future Enhancements
- RFM Analysis: Further user segmentation using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary analysis to optimize marketing and engagement strategies.
- Predictive Models: Potential implementation of machine learning models to predict bike demand based on weather forecasts and seasonal patterns.
